# Assignment1

This website was created to show the band, Claris's history, past and present members in the band, their albums and songs, as well as live events that are going to happen. Claris's official social accounts are also linked below to allow users to be able to access them easily. 

## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

On the index page, users can access the official social accounts of Claris. Users can navigate through the website using the menu sidebar.

On the profile page, users can read about the member's history, band history, as well as some illustrations for the band.

On the albums page, users can see some albums that Claris produced. The title of the album will bring users to Spotify, where they can listen to the album. The "Other Albums" button will bring users to another page, where users can see and listen to some songs that was used in tv-series or movies.

On the events page, users can check the new events that are going to happen. There is a countdown timer, counting down to the event. Image of the event location is also shown. If users click on the event name, they will be brought to the website where they can purchase tickets for that event.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
